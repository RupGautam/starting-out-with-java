# Chapter 3: Decision Structure 


###  The if Statement
The if statement is used to create a decision structure, which allows a program to have
one path of execution. The if statement causes one or more statement to execute only 
when a boolean expression is true. 


The below image explain the if-else statement.

### Type of if Statements: 

#### Sequence:
  A sequence structure is one that comprises instructions that are to be executed sequentially one after 
  the other, with branching off in another direction. 
  

#### Selection:
  A Selection(sometime it's also called decision too) structure allows for exactly one of a set  of 
  sequence to be executed. In selection, a question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program 
  take the second action, after which program move to the next event. 
    
  

#### Iteration:
  A Iteration or Loop structure comprises a sequence  that is  to be executed iteratively. Program repeatedly
  executes the loops. 
  
 
  
### Relational Operators: 
 

Precedence | Meaning |
--- | --- | 
 `>`| `Greater than` | 
`<` | `Less than` |
`>=`| `Greater than or equal to` |
`<=`|`Less than or equal to` |
`==`|`Equal to` |
`!=`|`Not Equal` |


### if Statement writing style 

Single statement example: 
  ```
    if (experssion)
      statement; --> semicolon goes here
  ```

More than one statement example: 
```
  if (experssion) {
    statement; --> semicolon goes here
  } else {
    statement; --> semicolon goes here
  }
     
```

Multiple statement example: 
```
  if (experssion)
     statement;
     else if (experssion)
     statement;
     else
     statement;
     
```
Or (by using brackets)
```
  if (experssion){ --> open bracket
     statement; --> semicolon 
     } --> closing bracket 
     else if (experssion){
     statement;
     }
     else {
     statement;
     }
     
```
