### Chapter 3: Decision Structure 


###  The if Statement
The if statement is used to create a decision structure, which allows a program to have
one path of execution. The if statement causes one or more statement to execute only 
when a boolean expression is true. 

The below image explain the if-else statement.

### Type of if Statements: 

#### Sequence:
  A sequence structure is one that comprises instructions that are to be executed sequentially one after 
  the other, with branching off in another direction. 
  

#### Selection:
  A Selection(sometime it's also called decision too) structure allows for exactly one of a set  of 
  sequence to be executed. In selection, a question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program 
  take the second action, after which program move to the next event. 
    
  

#### Iteration:
  A Iteration or Loop structure comprises a sequence  that is  to be executed iteratively. Program repeatedly
  executes the loops.
