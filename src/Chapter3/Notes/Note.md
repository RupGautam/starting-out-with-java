### Chapter 2: Java Fundamentals Notes


*Reading a Character :*

  The Scanner class does not have a method for reading a single character,

  and then use String class's charAt method to extract the first character of the string will solve the problem.
  
*Scanner method's annoying nextLine problem:*

  Will update later...
