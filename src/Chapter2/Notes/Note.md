### Chapter 2: Java Fundamentals Notes


*Reading a Character :*
  The Scanner class does not have a method for reading a single character,
  however. Using Scanner class's nextLine method to read a string from the keyboard,
  and then use String class's charAt method to extract the first character of the string will solve the problem.
  
*nextLine Scanner method's annoying problem :*
